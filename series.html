      <h1>Series</h1>
      <p>
        Last year I said Netflix kept on releasing interesting series but I
        think I cancelled and restarted my subscription twice this year. There
        was a definite lack of good series and I would have to look elsewhere to
        find good content. I even re-watched Weeds and Mad Men because I was
        looking for something good. Luckily, Apple launched Apple TV+ with two
        fun series and at the end of the year, the Witcher landed on Netflix, so
        all in all, it wasn’t that bad.

            <h2>Euphoria</h2>
            <p>
              A look at life for a group of high school students as they grapple
              with issues of drugs, sex, and violence. Maybe my favorite series
              of 2019. Strong acting by Zendaya. Each episode focusses on the
              backstory of a character while there is also a central story arc.

            <h2>The Witcher</h2>
            <p>
              The witcher Geralt, a mutated monster hunter, struggles to find
              his place in a world in which people often prove more wicked than
              beasts. I had never expected a video game adapation (well actually
              a book adaptation) to be this good. The Witcher is just lots of
              fun.

            <h2>The Morning Show</h2>
            <a href="#">Apple TV</a>
            <p>
              What happens when the people you trust to tell the truth prove
              themselves to be dishonest? The Morning Show follows the free fall
              of an early morning newscast in the wake of a scandal, and its
              struggle to survive in an era when news arrives in the palm of
              your hand. Look beyond the marketing images and just give this a
              chance for two episodes, I guarantee you will be hooked.

            <h2>Dickinson</h2>
            <a href="#">Apple TV</a>
            <p>
              Dickinson is a half hour comedy series starring Oscar nominee
              Hailee Steinfeld. Dickinson audaciously explores the constraints
              of society, gender, and family from the perspective of rebellious
              young poet Emily Dickinson. Dickinson mixes modern day pop music
              with a classic Victorian era setting. I like, it s funny, and the
              30 minute episodes are quite snackable.

            <a href="#">Netflix</a>
            <p>
              Four very different thirty something working mothers and friends
              try to balance their jobs, family life and love life in modern day
              Toronto, Canada. The humor is kind of weird but for some reason I
              kept on watching. Ideal one to turn your brain off in the evening.

              I think this series might be responsible for making me passionate
              about F1. Güenther Steiner ftw.

            <a href="#">Netflix</a>
            <p>
              A documentary that tells Bill Gates life story as he pursues
              solutions to some of the world s most complex problems. I m
              sending this documentary to anyone that thinks rich people are
              evil by default or to idiots who think anyone who has more than
              $1M should be taxed 100%. If you re wealthy you can spend it
              towards good things. Bill Gates proves this quite well in this
              doc.
