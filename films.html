      <h1>Movies</h1>
      <p>
        I spent quite a bit less time in the cinema than in 2018 which was
        definitely my “year of films”. I stopped my habit of going to the cinema
        regularly. However, I kept listening to BBC’s film podcast and did
        discover some gems throughout 2024.

            <h2>Never look away (Werk ohne Author)</h2>
            <p>
              German artist Kurt Barnert has escaped East Germany and now lives
              in West Germany, but is tormented by his childhood under the Nazis
              and the GDR-regime.<br />
              This was the best film of the year for me. Everyone should see
              this. I walked away from the cinema and had that rare “this is why
              I love film!” moment.

              A father and his thirteen year-old daughter are living an ideal
              existence in a vast urban park in Portland, Oregon, when a small
              mistake derails their lives forever. <br />

              The story of the legendary British rock band Queen and lead singer
              Freddie Mercury, leading up to their famous performance at Live
              Aid (1985).<br />

            <h2>The Favourite</h2>
            <p>
              In early 18th century England, a frail Queen Anne occupies the
              throne and her close friend, Lady Sarah, governs the country in
              her stead. When a new servant, Abigail, arrives, her charm endears
              her to Sarah.<br />
              Yorgos Lanthimos's films are usually too weird for me, but this
              one is good fun.

            <h2>Le Mans ‘66</h2>
            <p>
              American car designer Carroll Shelby and driver Ken Miles battle
              corporate interference, the laws of physics and their own personal
              demons to build a revolutionary race car for Ford and challenge
              Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1966. <br />Due to the hype
              I had a lot of expectations. Mark Kermode says that your
              experience of a film is determined by what you bring to it. I
              brought a half year of sim racing and this definitely influenced
              my views. But at 2.5hrs length, it flies by quite fast and is
              definitely good fun.

              Mary Stuart s attempt to overthrow her cousin Elizabeth I, Queen
              of England, finds her condemned to years of imprisonment before
              facing execution. <br />This film got poor reviews but I cannot
              not like a film with Saiorse Ronan. Check out the soundtrack by
              Max Richter as well.

              An idealistic FBI agent is enlisted by a government task force to
              aid in the escalating war against drugs at the border area between
              the U.S. and Mexico.<br />
              Yes, I know this film is from 2015; but I discovered why it's good
              this year.

              On the eve of their high school graduation, two academic

              and played more. Determined not to fall short of their peers, the
              girls try to cram four years of fun into one night.<br />
              Who doesn't love a good high school comedy? Turn off your brain

              A deactivated cyborg is revived, but cannot remember anything of
