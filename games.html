          2019 is the year that I properly got into sim racing. After visiting a
          friend and trying his rig I was convinced I wanted to spend some time
          exploring sim racing. It is a ton of fun, and combined with an
          interest in F1 and rally, a lot of my leisure time in 2019 had just
          one theme: racing.

          Looking back at the blog posts on my blog about sim racing ( , , , ) I
          was clearly always going a bit deeper into sim racing. The past few
          weeks have been so busy with work that I haven't had much time to
          race. I thzink I reached a point where I believe I need to put hundred
          of hours into it to improve just a little bit. For me, it's always
          been about the fun. Of course, being competitive is also fun. But I
          can't justify it to myself to spend hours and hours behind the sim rig
          to shave off a few seconds off a track time. So I think in 2020 I am
          just going to race less, but focus on the parts that are fun to me:
          discovering new tracks, new cars, maybe some racing with friends

          Observation: I have a penchant for deep simulation games, but these
          can take hundreds of hours, so I kind of only got to play them a
          little bit. Still; I find these games are still nice, even if it's
          only for a few hours.
